I could crawl into the spaces between the notes and curl my back to loneliness.\r\n\r\nIn my rented room (cooking privileges down the hall), I would play a record, then put my arms around the shoulders of the song. As we danced, glued together, I would nuzzle into its neck, kissing the skin, and rubbing its cheek with my own.\r\n\r\nThe Melrose Record Shop on Fillmore was a center for music, musicians, music lovers and record collectors.\n\nBlasts from its loudspeaker poured out into the street with all the insistence of a false mourner at a graveside. Along one wall of its dark interior, stalls were arranged like open telephone booths. Customers stood playing their selections on turntables and listening through earphones. I had two hours between jobs. Occasionally I went to the library or, if the hours coincided, to a free dance class at the YWCA. But most often I directed myself to the melodious Melrose Record Store, where I could wallow, rutting in music.\n\nThe tough texture of poverty in my life had been more real than sand wedged between my teeth, yet Mary Baker Eddy encouraged me to think myself prosperous. Every evening I went home to a fourteen-room house where my son and seventy-five-year-old Poppa Ford awaited my arrival. Mother usually was out dining with friends, drinking with acquaintances or gambling with strangers. Had she been there, her presence would not have greatly diminished my loneliness. My brother, who had been my ally, my first friend, had left home and closed himself to me.\n\nWe had found safety in numbers when we were young, but adulthood had severed the bonds and we drifted apart over deep and dangerous seas, unanchored.\r\n\r\nIn Mother\u2019s house, after dinner, I would read my son to sleep and return to the kitchen. Most often, the old man dreamt over an outsized cup of heavily sugared coffee. I would watch his aged ivory face, wrinkled under ghostly memories, then go to my room where solitude gaped whale-jawed wide to swallow me entire."},{"title":"Jazz as Communication","author":"Langston Hughes","year":"1956","category":"essay","content":"But I wasn\u2019t the only one putting jazz into words.

God, do you know how difficult it is, to talk about the day your own city dragged you by the hair, past the old prison, past the school gates, past the burning torsos erected on poles like flags? When I meet others like me I recognise the longing, the missing, the memory of ash on their faces. No one leaves home unless home is the mouth of a shark. I\u2019ve been carrying the old anthem in my mouth for so long that there\u2019s no space for another song, another tongue or another language. I know a shame that shrouds, totally engulfs. I tore up and ate my own passport in an airport hotel. I\u2019m bloated with language I can\u2019t afford to forget.\n\nThey ask me how did you get here? Can\u2019t you see it on my body? The Libyan desert red with immigrant bodies, the Gulf of Aden bloated, the city of Rome with no jacket. I hope the journey meant more than miles because all of my children are in the water. I thought the sea was safer than the land. I want to make love but my hair smells of war and running and running. I want to lay down, but these countries are like uncles who touch you when you\u2019re young and asleep. Look at all these borders, foaming at the mouth with bodies broken and desperate. I\u2019m the colour of hot sun on my face, my mother\u2019s remains were never buried. I spent days and nights in the stomach of the truck, I did not come out the same. Sometimes it feels like someone else is wearing my body\n\nI know a few things to be true. I do not know where I am going, where I have come from is disappearing, I am unwelcome and my beauty is not beauty here. My body is burning with the shame of not belonging, my body is longing. I am the sin of memory and the absence of memory. I watch the news and my mouth becomes a sink full of blood. The lines, the forms, the people at the desks, the calling cards, the immigration officer, the looks on the street, the cold settling deep into my bones, the English classes at night, the distance I am from home. But Alhamdulilah all of this is better than the scent of a woman completely on fire, or a truckload of men who look like my father, pulling out my teeth and nails, or fourteen men between my legs, or a gun, or a promise, or a lie, or his name, or his manhood in my mouth.\n\nI hear them say, go home, I hear them say, fucking immigrants, fucking refugees. Are they really this arrogant? Do they not know that stability is like a lover with a sweet mouth upon your body one second and the next you are a tremor lying on the floor covered in rubble and old currency waiting for its return. All I can say is, I was once like you, the apathy, the pity, the ungrateful placement and now my home is the mouth of a shark, now my home is the barrel of a gun. I\u2019ll see you on the other side."},{"title":"A Map of Utopia","author":"Rebecca Solnit","year":"2009","category":"essay","content":"This utopia matters, because almost everyone has experienced some version of it and because it is not the result of a partisan agenda but rather a broad, unplanned effort to salvage society and take care of the neighbors amid the wreckage. \u201cA map of the world that does not include Utopia is not worth even glancing at, for it leaves out the one country at which humanity is always heading,\u201d wrote Oscar Wilde fifteen years before San Francisco\u2019s great quake. The utopias built by citizens like Anna Hoshouser are not yet on that map. But they should be. They could change the map of our own beliefs, our sense of what is possible and who we are. Utopia is in trouble these days.\n\nMany no longer believe that a better world, as opposed to a better life, is possible, and the rhetoric of private well-being trumps public good, at least in the English-speaking world. And yet the yearning remains\u2014all the riches piled up, the security gates and stock options, are only defenses against a world of insecurity and animosity, piecemeal solutions to a pervasive problem. Sometimes it seems as though home improvement has trumped the idealistic notion of a better world. Sometimes.

Two Muslim women are attacked by a knife-wielding hate monger on a train.  A White House federal budget proposal aims to reduce the food stamps and Medicaid programs for millions of poor and working class Americans, in support of an effort to finance a tax cut strategy designed to disproportionately benefit the wealthy.  The Congressional Budget Office asserts that the latest GOP-led Congressional proposal to replace Obamacare would result in 23 million additional uninsured Americans, and adversely affect health premiums for older Americans.  Speaking of older Americans, funding for Meals On Wheels would be reduced.\n\nThis mean-spirited and inhumane set of civic and political events arrives on top of a narrative already frighteningly paved with racist, sexist, xenophobic, bullying, anti-immigrant, Islamophobic, anti-LGBTQ, anti-Trans, anti-women\u2019s health, and anti-voting and anti-civil rights activity since the November election.  The need for a \u201cmovement moment\u201d behind a counter-narrative is stark and clear.  We have seen protest marches, frustration, and great energy in response.  But we also need impactful, strategic discipline and coalition-building, and forward-thinking elements of our nonprofit and philanthropic sectors can play critical roles.  \n\nFor those Americans among us who hold issues of meaningful opportunity, inclusion, social justice and equity at the moral center of our belief system, the call to action has been gift-wrapped.

Just as black bodies are still seen as criminal, brown bodies are still seen as illegal, trans bodies are still seen as immoral, indigenous bodies are still seen as savage, the bodies of women and girls seen as someone else\u2019s property. And when we see these bodies not as brothers and sisters then it becomes easier to bully them, to rape them, to allow policies that neglect them, that incarcerate them, that kill them.\n\nSo the mother and me asks what if?

Williams","year":"2002","category":"article","content":"Understanding and addressing racial disparities in health in the United States must account for\u2014not simply document\u2014the relationship between race and socioeconomic status. In this article, we argue that race-based residential segregation is a fundamental cause of racial disparities in health, isolating many African Americans in spatially distinct neighborhoods where their access to the resources necessary to maintain health is limited. Communities in which large numbers of residents are impoverished have less political power and therefore have less control over their environment (e.g. the siting of industrial plants, the enforcement of environmental regulations) and greater exposure to hazards in the physical environment.\n\nSimilarly this framework suggests that residents of very poor communities also have less access to resources that help sustain daily life, including grocery stores and other retail outlets, as well as police, fire, and other municipal protection. Finally, we reviewed evidence showing that these intermediate factors influence more proximate factors related to health, including physical activities, dietary patterns, and social relationships. A substantial body of research evidence links various aspects of our model, and we believe that evidence is relevant. Identifying the relationships among fundamental, intermediate, and social factors can help us understand the multiple and dynamic mechanisms by which these factors cause racial disparities in health."},{"title":"It\u2019s Bias That Hobbles People of Color, Not Lack of a Leadership Pipeline","author":"Frances Kunreuther","year":"2017","category":"article","content":"We have too often relied on explanations that assume the deficit is in the potential pool of leaders. Instead, we should place the responsibility on those governing nonprofits who are not hiring people of color for executive-leadership positions.\r\n\r\nTalented, ambitious, and qualified people of color are ready to lead, but they are thwarted by assumptions about race, the idea of \u201ccultural fit,\u201d and preconceived notions of what a leader looks like\u2014the structural barriers that exist at nonprofits.\n\nGrant makers can do more to support organizations led by people of color that challenge board members\u2019 assumptions that whites are better at raising money. \r\n\r\nAnd everyone can push for changes in practices that perpetuate our racial hierarchies. Foundations and key nonprofit associations could take the lead by talking about racism, power, and privilege.\n\nAspiring leaders of color still need support that will help them face often unfounded assumptions about their skills and abilities. They will especially benefit from learning concrete ways to navigate and challenge the biases and systems they will encounter as they advance in their careers. \r\n\r\nThe benefits to organizations of fostering diverse leadership are clear from years and years of research. Nonprofits, especially those whose missions focus on social justice, must rethink how they go about elevating diverse voices to lead our organizations.\n\nAsking people of color to train their way out of the racial-leadership gap has not worked.\r\n\r\nInstead, we need to challenge the assumptions and implicit biases deeply embedded in nonprofits and in our society at large. These include educating board members, volunteers, and all who work at nonprofits on the best ways to achieve race equity. It is especially important to target recruiters and others who conduct executive searches so they present viable candidates of diverse races. All groups should institute good, effective human-resource practices that can compensate for biases at work."},{"title":"5 Questions Grant Makers Should Ask About the First 100 Days of Trump Era","author":"Aaron Dorfman","year":"2017","category":"article","content":"Are we using our voices to defend people most at risk? \r\n\r\nFoundations wield an immense amount of influence. Historically, most grant makers have been reluctant to speak out or to raise their profile on urgent issues, but there are times when our voices and our involvement are essential. We need to stand up for people and communities whose rights and opportunities are at risk, or who are being singled out for unjust and hateful treatment.\r\n\r\nWithin days of the election, the Minneapolis Foundation supported \u201cSambusa Sunday,\u201d which was organized by the Coalition of Somali American Leaders to counter anti-Muslim sentiment. The foundation saw this as a way to signal its strong support of full inclusion for Somalis in its city.\n\nThe Wallace Global Fund offered a different model for speaking out: The grant maker recently fired its law firm, which also represents the new president. The fund made public a four-page letter explaining how the firm\u2019s work for Mr. Trump is inconsistent with its values and with core democratic principles.\r\n\r\nStanding up in these ways will make many of us uncomfortable, but it is critical, particularly in smaller towns and rural communities where those most in need may have fewer supporters. To the extent that we raise our voices for justice and fairness, it will bring us closer to the people we seek to serve.\n\nPhilanthropy has an important role to play in building the kind of society in which we all want to live. Are we acting boldly as our country stands at a crossroads? Are we breaking from business as usual? Are we doing enough when so much of what we collectively believe in is at stake?\r\n\r\nThese are questions we all are grappling with. Some foundations have taken admirable and inspiring steps since November. But with 100 difficult days behind us and many more to come, it\u2019s time for all of philanthropy to think about how we can truly make a difference for the nonprofits, the communities, and the movements we support."},{"title":"What will you tell your daughters about 2016?","author":"Chinaka Hodge","year":"2016","category":"speech","content":"This year, we were women, not brides or trinkets, not an off-brand gender, not a concession, but women. \r\n\r\nInstruct your babies.

Then perhaps they were introduced to other areas, or just spread there naturally. They belong to the same species, so when black squirrels get with grey squirrels, or other black squirrels, fertile baby black squirrels result, sometimes in mixed litters with other colors. Perhaps these days the grey squirrel has a greater advantage camouflage-wise, but in urban areas where large predators are driven away by human activity the black squirrels could just as easily flourish. The mystery! The intrigue! The more I look into this, the more I\u2019m fascinated.\n\nThis is my favorite theory that I found: Apparently the thing that might be giving black squirrels the edge, according to the aforementioned radio story, is that the males seem to have more testosterone. Probably a female squirrel is more willing to get with the squirrel that has higher testosterone levels given that he works out and drives a sweet car. Also, picture this: A grey squirrel approaches a nut\u2014possibly one that struck someone\u2019s head outside of WesWings\u2014and then a black squirrel approaches and makes angry squirrel noises. In this situation the grey squirrel is more likely to back off, owing to its lowered levels of aggressiveness. Long story short, the black squirrel appears more able to protect its nuts. No pun intended."},{"title":"Hiddenness, Uncertainty, Surprise: Three Generative Energies of Poetry","author":"Jane Hirshfield","year":"2008","category":"essay","content":"The more surprise in good poetry is looked at, the more its work seems close to the work of the comic and the trickster: it argues against those things we most think we know. It is when unexamined assumptions of mind and nature are shaken that we are most moved, in the arts and science. Against gravity and entropic loss, a poem proposes the levitations of fine excess and gratuitous beauty\u2014sound-trance\u2019s memorability; the aerial devices of implication; metaphor\u2019s democratic conjugation with all existence; the praise of whatever it is for what it is. In a painting, a small square of sunlight rests on a rounded shoulder of a glass vase, preserved impossibly against time\u2019s passage; the pause in a piece of music by Mozart stops the heart for no reason except that is it there.\n\nAgainst transience, art provides a witnessing endurance, against the stringencies of survival, it offers the moment\u2019s dalliance or chosen disappearance. The love poem of fulfillment carries somewhere within it, however lightly, the shadow of time and death. A painted apple cannot be eaten. As evolution\u2019s creatures, we align with goal-attainment, self-protection, and the useful. The part of art which is art, and not device, unshackles us from usefulness almost entirely."},{"title":"The History of Kent: Historical and Biographical","author":"K.H. Grismer","year":"1932","category":"prose","content":"The village of Franklin Mills undoubtedly owed its existence to the Cuyahoga River, for it was this river, rushing and roaring through the narrow gorge above and below the present Crain Avenue bridge, which provided the water-power needed for the operation of grist and saw mills. As was the case throughout the entire Western Reserve, mills were built where waterpower existed, and where mills were built, there sprang up some of the most thriving settlements. The first person who sensed the possibilities of the river was Jacob Haymaker, a millwright and carpenter of German descent who prospected through the county in the spring of 1805, seeking a home site in the vast and practically unsettled wilderness.\n\nDuring the long winter which followed, the Haymakers\u2019 only visitors were Indians who came from their villages at Silver Lake and Cuyahoga Falls to see how white people lived. One day a squaw who came to visit took her papoose from her hack and stood the board to which it was attached against the hut. While she was inside talking to Mrs. Haymaker a wild hog came along, grabbed the baby, and ran helter-skelter through the underbrush. The squaw managed to rescue her baby but only after a hard fight with the animal.\n\nWith the coming of peace, the people of Franklin Township looked to the future with renewed hope. They were further encouraged by the occasional arrival of new neighbors. One of the newcomers was Elisha Stevens who bought a small tract of land on the west side of the river, near the present intersection of River and Mantua Streets, and erected a sawmill, to be operated by horsepower. Up to this time, very little timber was used except in the rough. As soon as Stevens had his mill in operation, the settlers were able, for the first time, to construct frame houses.\n\nAn event of unusual importance occurred on August 10, 1814. Franklin Township celebrated its first wedding! Neighbors from miles around gathered at noon at the home of Adam and Betsey Nighman to witness the marriage of their daughter Theresa to Christian Cackler, of Hudson, who had volunteered in the War of 1812 and had taken part in Perry\u2019s victorious engagement. After the ceremony was performed, the wedding dinner was served\u2014a substantial backwoods feast of beef, fowl and deer meat, together with as many different vegetables as could be procured. Following the dinner there was a dance which lasted into the small hours of the morning.\n\nThe streets were cleaned with meticulous care, old rubbish piles were removed, weeds were cut from vacant lots, and the citizens were urged to make their homes look as attractive as possible. Kent gleamed and glistened. But when the day came for the commission to appear, it rained and rained.  Determined to make the best of a bad situation, the members of the Board of Trade committee secured boots for the commissioners and took them to the hill on the W.S. Kent farm. They waded through mud and sloshed through wet underbrush. Finally they came to the peak of the, hill where they could look over the town.

The name came from a Greek word meaning \"an elevation\" or \"point.\" Originally, the community was located slightly south of its present location, in modern-day South Akron. Many of the town's earliest residents were Irish migrants employed to build the nearby Ohio and Erie Canal. After 1827, when the canal was completed between Akron and Cleveland, the community's business interests really began to prosper. Its location along the canal meant that many farmers brought their crops to Akron to be milled and then transported to other markets, and manufacturing interests such as mills, furnaces, and textiles also emerged.\n\nBy the second half of the 1800s, railroads connected the community to other important cities in Ohio, and other industries emerged. There were a number of stoneware and cereal manufacturers, as well as a well-known sewer pipe industry. The Barber Match Company, later a branch of the Diamond Match Company, produced one-fifth of all the matches in the United States. The Buckeye Mower and Reaper Company, originally located in Canton, moved to Akron in 1863. Probably among the most famous companies established in Akron were the B.F. Goodrich Company and the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, both rubber and tire manufacturers that began to prosper after the advent of the automobile age. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, many migrants from the Appalachian region and European immigrants came to Akron looking for work in these industries. There was also a significant African American population going back prior to the Civil War."},{"title":"The Chosen Ones: LeBron and Akron","author":"David Giffels","year":"2014","category":"prose","content":"\u2026the last-ever passenger tire was built in Akron by a man named Richard Mayo, who paused afterward to look into a newspaper camera, a sturdy man in a V-neck T-shirt, thirty years on the job, his gloved fist perched on his hip, the other against his forehead, hands unsure what to do with themselves.

How addiction has been defined historically has varied depending on the substance (e.g., alcohol, cannabis, heroin), and has been influenced by intersecting factors such as race, gender, political, cultural, and geographic context.\n\nAddiction, despite its common usage, has never been an official diagnostic term. Its potential inclusion in the 5th edition Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) generated intense debate because addiction is often used interchangeably with physiological and psychological dependence; a problem for pain management involving opioids where tolerance and withdrawal (cardinal features of physical dependence) are expected. The proposed DSM clarification was to minimize the harms of \u201cunder-treatment\u201d of pain patients where addiction (i.e. dependence) was suspected.

Human anatomy is that division of general anatomy which applies to the structure of man, bearing in mind the fact that man is distinguished as a separate genus among primate mammals, an order of vertebrates.\n\nThe present work is an account of the various parts and organs of the human body, being descriptive of their characteristics as revealed by dissection, and with a view toward practical application, certain parts or regions of the body are examined in their entirety. These two methods of studying anatomy are conventionally termed descriptive anatomy and applied or topographic anatomy. Embryology deals with the origin and development of the body and its organs. Histology deals with the minute structure of the tissues and organs as revealed by the microscope. In the present work only brief accounts of the embryology and histology of the organs are interpolated in their proper places; the minute details must be sought for in special works upon the subjects.\n\nMan as a vertebrate possesses an internal skeleton with a median longitudinal axis, which is divided transversely into segments called vertebrae. This vertebral azis in the habitually erect position of the human body is supported by the pelvic limbs, and is surmounted by the skull. The pelvic limbs serve the purpose of progression, while the pectoral limbs are adapted as organs of prehension; a distinction common to nearly all primates is the possession of an opposable first digit or thumb. The possession of milk glands, rudimentary in the male, but well developed and important in the female, relegates the human species to the class of mammals."},{"title":"The Chatpattey Room: Refugees Creating a Home\u2014and a Business\u2014in the Rust Belt","author":"Kailey Sherrick","year":"2015","category":"article","content":"Naresh settles himself at one of the picnic tables, resting his back against the wall.

But when I looked closely at the rough drafts of the Declaration, the full texts gave me reason to pause. The high-flown passage about slavery that Congress edited out stopped me in my tracks. Here it is again:\r\n\r\n\u201c[King George III] has waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating its most sacred rights of life & liberty in the persons of a distant people who never offended him, captivating & carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere, or to incur miserable death in their transportation thither...\n\n...This piratical warfare, the opprobrium of infidel powers, is the warfare of the Christian king of Great Britain, determined to keep open a market where MEN should be bought and sold...\u201d\r\n\r\nThis paragraph shares many words with the first two sentences of the Declaration \u2013 nature, nature\u2019s sacred rights of life and liberty. Yet here these words describe Africans being sold into slavery and the violation of their natural rights. Then Jefferson talks about markets where \u201cMEN,\u201d which he capitalizes, are bought and sold. In other words, he is calling the slaves \u201cmen.\u201d And when he does this, he can\u2019t mean males only, because those markets were for men, women, and children. So when, in the second sentence, he writes that all men are created equal, he must mean all people \u2013 whatever their color, sex, age, or status.\n\nHere it is important to say some things about who Jefferson was. He was, of course, a slave owner. He took as a concubine one of his slaves, Sally Hemings, who was also his dead wife\u2019s halfsister. She became his thirty-three-year partner, and the couple had six children, two of whom died in childhood. What became of the others? Two simply moved away from Monticello as adults and began living as white people, while Jefferson freed the two youngest in his will. In his will he also freed three other older men alongside them, but he did not free his many other slaves.\n\nHow could Jefferson write so eloquently about slavery as a violation of the rights of men, women, and children and not disavow his own complicity in the peculiar institution? Which was the real Jefferson? The one who wrote these words or the one who lived within the slave system in ways that both affirmed and contradicted its order? Or was he simply a repugnant and hypocritical egoist, as one of my friends once said to me?\r\n \r\nJefferson\u2019s story is another mystery of the Declaration."},{"title":"Why Soccer Matters","author":"Pel\u00e9 and Brian Winters","year":"2014","category":"book","content":"In 1969, the year before the World Cup in Mexico, I began to approach an unprecedented milestone in soccer \u2013 one thousand career goals.

My career totals included my games with Santos, the Brazilian team, and even the year I played with the military upon my return from Sweden.

Man, not satisfied with the mental confusion and unhappiness to be derived from contemplating the cruelties of life and the riddle of the universe, delights to occupy his leisure moments with puzzles and bugaboos. The pages of every magazine and newspaper swarm with cross-words, mathematical tricks, puzzle-pictures, enigmas, acrostics, and detective-stories, as also with stories of the kind called \u201cpowerful\u201d (which means unpleasant), and those which make him afraid to go to bed. It may be that in them he finds a sort of catharsis or purging of his fears and self-questionings.\n\nThese mysteries made only to be solved, these horrors which he knows to be mere figments of the creative brain, comfort him by subtly persuading that life is a mystery which death will solve, and whose horrors will pass away as a tale that is told. Or it may be merely that his animal faculties of fear and inquisitiveness demand more exercise than the daily round affords. Or it may be pure perversity. The fact remains that if you search the second-hand bookstalls for his cast-off literature, you will find fewer mystery stories than any other kind of book. Theology and poetry, philosophy and numismatics, love-stories and biography, he discards as easily as old razor-blades, but Sherlock Holmes and Wilkie Collins are cherished and read and re-read, till their covers fall off and their pages crumble to fragments."},{"title":"Other Russias: An Interview with Victoria Lomasko","author":"James McNally with Victoria Lomasko","year":"2017","category":"interview","content":"\u201cOther Russias\u201d was not conceived as a book for an American audience, or created for export.

I felt the force of the love-hate relationship between our two countries, which are, to a certain extent, mirror images of one another.  The election of Donald Trump points to the many similar problems our countries face: the rollback of social services and rise of inequality, as well as the strong nationalistic mood amongst a large portion of the population.\n\nI thought it was funny that people believed that there was a Russian conspiracy to elect Trump, and that Putin controlled him. It\u2019s like in Russia, where instead of society acknowledging its own mistakes, everyone always blames America.

Why did we leave a place of comfort toward something unknown? Those are questions I still ask myself, but they evolved from being asked in childlike fear to being embraced in pursuit of remarkable journeys as an adult.\n\nMy circuitous path from that six-year-old getting sick on a flight to three decades later has been full of discovery. And discovery is something science is exceedingly good at doing, which is one reason I gravitated toward it. My interest in science has given me experiences like smelling thousand-year-old air as I excavated ancient stone buildings in thick jungles so we can document and learn about our past, and uncovering story after story with each layered removal of dirt. (Next time, I should tell you the story about waking up to a giant spider literally on my face!) \r\n     That interest led to me being invited on a global team of scientists and scholars, spanning fields from Linguistics to Geologic Climatology, working together on a shared problem and communicating it in the highest impact science publications in the world.\n\nIt gave me the opportunity to talk about the role of climate change in the ancient Maya world for a video that was screened at the 2014 United Nations Convention on Climate Change. \r\n     More recently, it took me to the frontline of organizing the largest globally coordinated event for science advocacy, making both history and setting a personal record of weight loss.\r\n     But as I said, I come from a long line of workers and providers, and I know there is so much more to be done in service to science and society.

Despite this, my love for science and exploration faded by my teen years and didn\u2019t revisit me until my late 20\u2019s. It was as I watched the last Space Shuttle mission online, STS-135 (July 8, 2011), that I felt a space shuttle sized hole in my heart. That sense of \u201cWell crap, now what?\u201d led me down a path of learning about the past and future of space exploration.\r\n     One day while browsing online, I stumbled upon a used Russian high altitude flight suit on an auction site. I had no intentions of what I\u2019d do with the thing, but next thing I know I have a Russian flight suit at my doorstep. After a few months of it taunting me, I eventually started taking funny pictures of myself in the suit, and that\u2019s how my project, Everyday Astronaut, was born.\n\nThe theme of kid-like curiosity of an astronaut stuck on earth exploring his own planet while waiting for his chance to fly, fueled the inspiration for me to turn Everyday Astronaut into a tool to help people get as excited as I am about the future of space flight. Since purchasing the suit in 2013, Everyday Astronaut has traveled the world, YouTube and Instagram frontiers as a spaceflight advocate and science communicator. \r\n      Science has taught me so much.

So why space?\n\nI think the 1975 Apollo\/Soyuz mission sums up my feelings on why space is so important: In 1975, the United States and our cold war enemy, the Soviet Union, linked spacecrafts in space for the first time. Our innate human desire to explore came together and bridged the gap between two enemies as we shared handshakes and gifts in orbit. \r\n     This is what space represents for all of us humans who share this planet together.

In high school, my physics teacher showed me how to calculate the trajectory of a water balloon fired from a slingshot. I was hooked. \r\n     I went on to study particle physics, eventually earning my PhD. Yet physics couldn\u2019t provide answers to all of the problems that were important to me. In between my early studies and lab work, I took to the streets to organize my community in our fight for marriage equality. When I moved on to graduate school, balancing both efforts became too much. I put my activism aside to focus on my research. That didn\u2019t last long.\r\n     Two years later, something was missing. I began questioning whether a career in academia was right for me. I switched gears again, this time shelving my science completely to direct campaign offices during the 2008 presidential election.\n\nDespite the amazing friends I made and exhilarating experiences I had, I still felt a longing to be part of the scientific community. Confused and unsure, I decided to return to finish my PhD and sneak in community organizing where I could. \r\n     It wasn\u2019t until the end of graduate school that my path finally became clear. I received an email from my advisor about a science policy fellowship. Was \u201cScience Policy\u201d an actual thing? Had my meandering path uniquely prepared me for a career I didn\u2019t even know existed? Maybe I didn\u2019t have to choose between science and policy after all.\r\n     Early on in my time in DC I met with a senior congressional staffer. They told me that working on the Hill is a lot like working in science: you form a hypothesis and then go out and find data to support it. \r\n     Only, that\u2019s not how science works.\n\nIn science, we don\u2019t go looking for data to confirm what we think will be true. Used correctly, the goal of science is actually to defend against that impulse. We collect data to test a hypothesis, allowing for the possibility that we were incorrect. If that happens, we often need to change the way we think about a problem. \r\n     The staffer\u2019s misstatement of the scientific method led me to a critical realization: science can and should play a role in public policy. Scientists train their whole lives to do objective analysis that allows for changing perspectives, which is sorely needed in our current political climate. But there\u2019s work to be done on both sides.\n\nScientists need to realize that science is one of many important inputs for public policy. We also need to do more than just create knowledge; we need to make sure that knowledge makes it into the hands of the people who can do something with it. \r\n     And policymakers need to do their part when scientists show up. They need to appreciate the scientific method and set responsible standards for incorporating evidence into policy \u2013 even when the data don\u2019t fit their hypothesis."},{"title":"Science as a Verb","author":"Dr. Marguerite Matthews","year":"2018","category":"essay","content":"To most people I am credited as being a scientist because I have a PhD in neuroscience.

And while I officially science from 9 to 5 for my profession, I also science when I\u2019m at home, in my periodic table of elements leggings, when Googling NASA\u2019s latest missions into space, or while explaining on Twitter why our emotions aren\u2019t controlled by our physical hearts."},{"title":"I March Everyday","author":"Sami","year":"2018","category":"interview","content":"While I was a part of a much larger collective during the Science March, I march everyday within my field to push it to be more inclusive from within. \r\n     As a queer, multiracial (Chinese, Scots-Irish, Welsh, and Cherokee) female scientist with dyslexia, I believe our way to collectively improve science is through community engagement.

One of my favorite things was when we turned the White House into a science fair. We invited kids from all around the country to show off their research. And wow. \r\n     Take for example, Nathan, who was 15 at the time and built machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms to detect genetic mutations that are likely to cause cancer. Simon-Peter, Maya, and Grayson \u2013 at 13 and 14 - designed a new prosthetic leg that will allow an amputee to hike, manage uneven terrain, and even skateboard! And 17 year old Olivia developed a rapid, portable, and inexpensive diagnostic test for detecting the Ebola virus.\n\nThese kids are from every walk of life. From every part of America. Spend five minutes with them and you\u2019ll leave the conversation with an incredible inferiority complex.\r\n     Science and engineering can\u2019t wait. Slowing down isn\u2019t an option. Kids in Flint, Michigan still don\u2019t have clean water. The climate is changing. The next pandemic could be around the corner. We have a growing world population that needs to be fed and educated. Our national defenses will continue to depend on innovation. And cancer and rare diseases continue to take too many lives.\r\n     When I was in the White House, I also met Jennifer Bittner, who wrote to the President \u2013 yes we did read the letters you sent, and actually respond. Here\u2019s the first thing you need to know about Jennifer: she\u2019s a beautiful person, a wonderful wife to her husband Rod, and a phenomenal mother to their son and the child that is on the way. She is a force of nature.\n\nThis is what Jennifer said in her own words:\r\n      I was diagnosed with Stage IV metastatic breast cancer that had spread to my liver, lungs, adrenal gland, spleen, ovaries, spine, hips, ribs, femur, scapula, clavicle, and many other bones. One doctor said I\u2019d be in hospice within three months. While it\u2019s hard to put into words how grateful I am to have had every single moment of this wonderful life the past few years, it\u2019s certainly not easy. I\u2019ve been on chemotherapy or other treatment every single day. I\u2019ve endured multiple surgeries and radiation, as well as the anxiety of weekly tumor markers and scans every three months. My treatment side effects are challenging and at times, debilitating. Despite all of this, the average life expectancy of someone with metastatic breast cancer is just three short years.\n\nThree years is far too short when you\u2019re not even halfway through life. Research is absolutely critical to extending and improving the lives of people with cancer -- especially now that we are on the precipice of some incredible medical breakthroughs such as immunotherapies. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so critical that research be fully funded. We are so close but most of us can\u2019t wait much longer. \r\n     Cancer doesn\u2019t wait. Rare diseases don\u2019t wait. Pandemics don\u2019t wait. Our kids can\u2019t wait. \r\n     When we come together as a nation; when we focus as a community; and when we are relentless in our determination to support all the sciences, we will keep science in its rightful place leading our country forward. Forward for a positive future for my children, your children, the world\u2019s children, and our children\u2019s\u2019 children.\r\n     Science can\u2019t wait.

This program provides millions of dollars each year to fund research on the effects of chemical exposure on children and adults. By combining the Office of Administrative and Research Support, the Office of Program Accountability and Resource Management, and the NCER into one department, the EPA claims that they will create a more efficient agency. \r\n     But we cannot allow our leaders to trade in dedicated funding and programming for vital initiatives like the the Children\u2019s Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research Centers for the sake of a smaller agency. And we certainly cannot sit on the sidelines as an important agency that safeguards the health and safety of our communities and environments is gutted.\n\nThis is, unfortunately what we\u2019ve come to expect from Scott Pruitt\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We must demand that Pruitt and Congress not only preserve essential research programs at the EPA, but continue to fight for increased funding for the vital research of the Science to Achieve Results (STAR) program, funded by the NCER. We need answers on how environmental factors affect children in order to write the policies we need to protect them. \r\n    The EPA mandate is to safeguard our health and environment.

I stand in front of you as a Latina, a Mexicana, and as a female scientist. My identity is a source of strength. My existence is resistance.\r\n     As a selfless act of love, my parents brought me from Mexico to the US, in order to have access to higher education. To honor their sacrifice, me puse las pilas, and became the first in my family to obtain a degree.\r\n     As an undergrad with DACA status, I had limited access to financial aid. This led me to work multiple full-time jobs to cover my tuition, and took time away from my studies. Meanwhile, my father often traveled out of state to find work. As the eldest in my household, I had to help my mom, and look after my siblings. Work, school, and being the head of household was difficult to handle.\n\nEventually, I found myself having to make the choice between family and school. One of the most difficult decisions I ever made, and felt like betrayal to my family, was moving to California to get my PhD. Especially during this past year, while my family evacuated their home because of Hurricane Harvey, and I was stuck a thousand miles away.\r\n     Getting into graduate school was not easy. Institutional and systemic barriers that already exist against me as a Latina, are only heightened as an undocumented student.\r\n     And yet here I am, making my parents sacrifices count by getting my PhD. I\u2019m in my second year at the University of California Irvine, where my work focuses on the effects of climate change on the interactions between plants and soil microbes. I\u2019m helping make a difference for Latinx students and undocumented students who want to pursue higher education.\n\nWe contribute to this nation in invaluable ways. Dreamers are in our scientific communities. Dreamers are helping fight climate change. Dreamers are doing the science that will bring this nation to the next level.\r\n     This fight is about this nation losing prospective students, because we stand to lose talented minds if they do not find support here. We desperately need a scientific community that reflects our nation\u2019s demographics.\r\n     To remain academically and globally competitive, we must harness the powerful work of ALL Dreamers, and ALL students. And provide support regardless of background, sexual orientation, or citizenship status.\n\nAs I stand here, surrounded by influential people in power, I want to say, change starts with you. A true ally makes their voice heard. A true ally uses their influence for positive change. Because everyone plays an important role in ensuring that this nation becomes a safe place to learn. Free from policies that create divisions within our community. Don\u2019t stand idly by while your community, and your colleagues, are hurting. I encourage you to step up. And make your voice heard."},{"title":"Crisis and Commitment","author":"Dr. Omayra Ortega","year":"2018","category":"speech","content":"We live at a time when our government is weakening its commitment to science and we cannot let that happen. For generations the United States of America has been a world leader in scientific innovation. Most of these innovations came from publicly funded science, this includes funding for research and funding for agencies such as the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. The National Institutes of Health or NIH is a leader in biomedical research. The annual budget for the NIH has been slowly cut down by almost 20 percent since 2003. Funding from the National Institutes of Health flows to more than 2,600 institutions around the country (including K-12 schools, universities, museums, national organizations, and national labs) this creates more than 313,000 full- and part-time jobs so cutting funding to the NIH is not only a blow to medical research but a blow to national employment as well.\n\nThe reduction in funds to these national institutes has a trickle down effect and reduces the number of women, first-generation students, people of color, and people labeled with disabilities who can be supported to train as scientists at a time when we need more people to join the ranks of scientists. There has been a national call to increase the number of scientists and we need a more diverse population of Americans who are trained in things like computer science, engineering, mathematics, and science.\r\n     This funding crisis comes at a time when we are so close to solving many of the world\u2019s health issues through the biomedical research through advances started by the sequencing of the human genome. There have been astounding leaps accomplished in drug development to treat and cure some of our most devastating diseases.\n\nThe 21st century could become the century of biology and medicine by turning more disease interventions into cures and accelerating the pace of basic research necessary to improve health and life expectancy. For this reason we need to increase funding to our nation\u2019s federally funded scientific institutes.\r\n     Did you know that in America a person of color is twice as likely as their European-American counterparts to die of heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, kidney disease, maternal health, infant mortality\u2026the list goes on. We need to ensure 100% health coverage to all people living in the United States. We need to improve quality, affordability, and equity in our health system. Health equity means that everyone has a fair and just opportunity to be healthier. This requires removing obstacles to health such as poverty, discrimination, and their consequences. This will not be an easy task.\n\nWe need public coverage options that are determined by scientific evidence-based public policy and accountability rather than the whims of private insurers and politicians.\r\n     So what can each of us, here, do about this?\r\n     We can go out and vote! If you are not registered please make sure to register today. The people representing you in your local state and federal government need to hear from you. Make sure that you call and write to your representatives so that your voice is heard and your opinion is known.\n\nI encourage each and every one of you to engage in science. Take your friends, family, co-workers, and loved ones to the Fleet Science Center in Balboa Park, check out the Maritime Museum and learn about the marine life in our oceans, plan a beach or park clean up day, grow your own vegetables at home or in a community garden. Become an involved citizen, one who engages with their representatives in government, engages with the health care system, and engages in the science that is all around them."},{"title":"The Apology Resolution","author":"103d Congress Joint Resolution 19","year":"1993","category":"article","content":"To acknowledge the 100th anniversary of the January 17, 1893 overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, and to offer an apology to Native Hawaiians on behalf of the United States for the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii.\r\n     Whereas, prior to the arrival of the first Europeans in 1778, the Native Hawaiian people lived in a highly organized, self-sufficient, subsistent social system based on communal land tenure with a sophisticated language, culture, and religion; Whereas, a unified monarchical government of the Hawaiian Islands was established in 1810 under Kamehameha I, the first King of Hawaii; Whereas, from 1826 until 1893, the United States recognized the independence of the Kingdom of Hawaii, extended full and complete diplomatic recognition to the Hawaiian Government, and entered into treaties and conventions with the Hawaiian monarchs to govern commerce and navigation in 1826, 1842, 1849, 1875, & 1887;\n\nWhereas, the Congregational Church (now known as the United Church of Christ), through its American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, sponsored and sent more than 100 missionaries to the Kingdom of Hawaii between 1820 and 1850;\r\n     Whereas, on January 14, 1893, John L.

character as well as the rights of the injured people requires we should endeavor to repair\" and called for the restoration of the Hawaiian monarchy;\r\n     Whereas, the Provisional Government protested President Cleveland's call for the restoration of the monarchy and continued to hold state power and pursue annexation to the United States;\n\nWhereas, the Provisional Government successfully lobbied the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate (hereafter referred to in this Resolution as the \"Committee\") to conduct a new investigation into the events surrounding the overthrow of the monarchy;\r\n     Whereas, the Committee and its chairman, Senator John Morgan, conducted hearings in Washington, D.C., from December 27,1893, through February 26, 1894, in which members of the Provisional Government justified and condoned the actions of the United States Minister and recommended annexation of Hawaii;\r\n     Whereas, although the Provisional Government was able to obscure the role of the United States in the illegal overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy, it was unable to rally the support from two-thirds of the Senate needed to ratify a treaty of

One of the reasons for this, of course, is that in its founding it delineated a set of defining values for itself that were false; those of different colored skin and different genders were excluded from the polity. More than two centuries in and we are still defined by gender based inequality enforced by executive, legislative and judicial law. This disconnect between thought and deed is part of what must be thought of as \"American.\"\n\n\"American\" must also mean multiplicities as we are a nation of countless ethnicities, countless languages, and countless experiences, none of which have a greater or lesser claim to life in the \"nation\" than any other. And truth be told, in a place where any place has two names or more, we are not \"one nation\" after all, but many.

Yet there runs throughout the opinions of my Brothers POWELL and STEVENS another vein I find equally disturbing: a depressing inability to appreciate that in our land of cultural pluralism, there are many who think, act, and talk differently from the Members of this Court, and who do not share their fragile sensibilities.

On occasions where they treat themselves to a movie or dinner at a restaurant, they blend with the crowd. In mind-set and appearance, they are largely middle class. They wash their clothes at Laundromats and join fitness clubs to use the showers. Many took to the road after their savings were obliterated by the Great Recession. To keep their gas tanks and their bellies full, they work long hours at hard, physical jobs. In a time of flat wages and rising housing costs, they have unshackled themselves from rent and mortgages to get by. They are surviving America.\n\nBut for them\u2013\u2013as for anyone\u2013\u2013survival isn\u2019t enough. So what began as a last-ditch effort has become a battle cry for something greater.

Around a shared campfire, in the middle of the night, it can feel like a glimpse of utopia. \r\n\tAs I write, it is autumn. Soon winter will come. Routine layoff will start at the seasonal jobs.

Leroy has been home in Kentucky for three months, and his leg is almost healed, but the accident frightened him and he does not want to drive any more long hauls. He is not sure what to do next. In the meantime, he makes things from craft kits. He started by building a miniature log cabin from notched Popsicle sticks. He varnished it and placed it on the TV set, where it remains. It reminds him of a rustic Nativity scene. .

There was no room for refusal, for thoughts or ideas, it was all just a moment felt, emotions bubbling forth from losses the Hmong had endured. In his song, I was no longer young.

As a matter of fact my experience in nautical affairs had been confined to sailing miniature yachts on the Serpentine in Hyde Park, but I thought I had considerable theoretical knowledge obtained from the romances of Marryatt and Chamier, and Dana\u2019s excellent book: \u201cTwo Years Before the Mast.\u201d\n\nThe battle of Fredericksburg was at hand. I need not describe it, except to say that from Howison\u2019s Hill, afterwards known as Lee\u2019s Hill, where Generals Lee and Longstreet and their staffs remained for a considerable part of the day, there was a magnificent view of as grand a spectacle as one could desire to see in war. . . Large bodies of troops had already crossed the Rappahannock, and the field near it were blue with Yankess. On the opposite shoare were the long trains and wagons and ambulances, together with the reserve artillery. A 30-pound Parrot gun which we had was ordered to open on the enemy, and very soon the artillery fire became brisk. Fredericksburg, which had been so calm and peaceful in early light, was set on fire by the enemy\u2019s shells. . .

Utterly, indeed, should I despair did not the presence of many whom I here see remind me that in the other high authorities provided by our Constitution I shall find resources of wisdom, of virtue, and of zeal on which to rely under all difficulties.\n\nTo you, then . . . I look with encouragement for that guidance and support which may enable us to steer with safety the vessel in which we are all embarked amidst the conflicting elements of a troubled world. All, too, will bear in mind this sacred principle, that though the will of the majority is in all cases to prevail, that will to be rightful must be reasonable; that the minority possess their equal rights, which equal law must protect, and to violate would be oppression. Let us, then, fellow-citizens, unite with one heart and one mind. Let us restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection without which liberty and even life itself are but dreary things. And let us reflect that, having banished from our land that religious intolerance under which mankind so long bled and suffered, we have yet gained little if we countenance a political intolerance as despotic, as wicked, and capable of as bitter and bloody persecutions. . .\n\nBut every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle. We have called by different names brethren of the same principle. We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists. If there be any among us who would wish to dissolve this Union or to change its republican form, let them stand undisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it. I know, indeed, that some honest men fear that a republican government can not be strong, that this Government is not strong enough; but would the honest patriot, in the full tide of successful experiment, abandon a government which has so far kept us free and firm on the theoretic and visionary fear that this Government, the world's best hope, may by possibility want energy to preserve itself?

These principles form the bright constellation which has gone before us and guided our steps through an age of revolution and reformation. The wisdom of our sages and blood of our heroes have been devoted to their attainment. They should be the creed of our political faith, the text of civic instruction, the touchstone by which to try the services of those we trust; and should we wander from them in moments of error or of alarm, let us hasten to retrace our steps and to regain the road which alone leads to peace, liberty, and safety."},{"title":"Make the Slave\u2019s Case Our Own","author":"Susan B.

Think of it: A Christianity that traffics in human beings, that barters God\u2019s image for filthy lucre. And here is the Gospel of Jesus Christ preached to the poor slave. Think of it! A Gospel that transforms every sixth child of God into chattel. A Gospel that sells Jesus Christ himself in the person of the slave auction block. What a profanation. What blasphemy! Such a Gospel can be none other that that of the bottomless pit.

When our Lord and Master Jesus Christ said, \"Repent'' (Mt 4:17), he willed the entire life of believers to be one of repentance.\u2028\r\n2. This word cannot be understood as referring to the sacrament of penance, that is, confession and satisfaction, as administered by the clergy.\u2028\r\n3. Yet it does not mean solely inner repentance; such inner repentance is worthless unless it produces various outward mortification of the flesh.\u2028\r\n4. The penalty of sin remains as long as the hatred of self (that is, true inner repentance), namely till our entrance into the kingdom of heaven.\u2028\r\n5. The pope neither desires nor is able to remit any penalties except those imposed by his own authority or that of the canons.\u2028\n\n6. The pope cannot remit any guilt, except by declaring and showing that it has been remitted by God; or, to be sure, by remitting guilt in cases reserved to his judgment. If his right to grant remission in these cases were disregarded, the guilt would certainly remain unforgiven.\u2028\r\n7. God remits guilt to no one unless at the same time he humbles him in all things and makes him submissive to the vicar, the priest.\u2028\r\n8. The penitential canons are imposed only on the living, and, according to the canons themselves, nothing should be imposed on the dying.\u2028\r\n9. Therefore the Holy Spirit through the pope is kind to us insofar as the pope in his decrees always makes exception of the article of death and of necessity.\u2028\r\n10. Those priests act ignorantly and wickedly who, in the case of the dying, reserve canonical penalties for purgatory.\u2028\n\n11. Those tares of changing the canonical penalty to the penalty of purgatory were evidently sown while the bishops slept (Mt 13:25).\u2028\r\n12. In former times canonical penalties were imposed, not after, but before absolution, as tests of true contrition.\u2028\r\n13. The dying are freed by death from all penalties, are already dead as far as the canon laws are concerned, and have a right to be released from them.\u2028\r\n14. Imperfect piety or love on the part of the dying person necessarily brings with it great fear; and the smaller the love, the greater the fear.\u2028\r\n15. This fear or horror is sufficient in itself, to say nothing of other things, to constitute the penalty of purgatory, since it is very near to the horror of despair.\u2028\r\n16. Hell, purgatory, and heaven seem to differ the same as despair, fear, and assurance of salvation.\u2028\n\n17. It seems as though for the souls in purgatory fear should necessarily decrease and love increase.\u2028\r\n18. Furthermore, it does not seem proved, either by reason or by Scripture, that souls in purgatory are outside the state of merit, that is, unable to grow in love.\u2028\r\n19. Nor does it seem proved that souls in purgatory, at least not all of them, are certain and assured of their own salvation, even if we ourselves may be entirely certain of it.\u2028\r\n20. Therefore the pope, when he uses the words \u201cplenary remission of all penalties,'' does not actually mean \u201call penalties,'' but only those imposed by himself.\u2028\r\n21. Again, \u201cWhy are funeral and anniversary masses for the dead continued and why does he not return or permit the withdrawal of the endowments founded for them, since it is wrong to pray for the redeemed?''\u2028\n\n22. Again, \u201cWhat is this new piety of God and the pope that for a consideration of money they permit a man who is impious and their enemy to buy out of purgatory the pious soul of a friend of God and do not rather, beca use of the need of that pious and beloved soul, free it for pure love's sake?''\u2028\r\n23. Again, \u201cWhy are the penitential canons, long since abrogated and dead in actual fact and through disuse, now satisfied by the granting of indulgences as though they were still alive and in force?''\u2028\r\n24. Again, \u201cWhy does not the pope, whose wealth is today greater than the wealth of the richest Crassus, build this one basilica of St. Peter with his own money rather than with the money of poor believers?''\u2028\r\n25. Again, \u201cWhat does the pope remit or grant to those who by perfect contrition already have a right to full remission and blessings?''\u2028\n\n26. Again, \u201cWhat greater blessing could come to the church than if the pope were to bestow these remissions and blessings on every believer a hundred times a day, as he now does but once?''\u2028\r\n27. \u201cSince the pope seeks the salvation of souls rather than money by his indulgences, why does he suspend the indulgences and pardons previously granted when they have equal efficacy?''\u2028\r\n28. To repress these very sharp arguments of the laity by force alone, and not to resolve them by giving reasons, is to expose the church and the pope to the ridicule of their enemies and to make Christians unhappy.\u2028\r\n29. If, therefore, indulgences were preached according to the spirit and intention of the pope, all these doubts would be readily resolved. Indeed, they would not exist.\u2028\n\n30. Away, then, with all those prophets who say to the people of Christ, \"Peace, peace,'' and there is no peace! (Jer 6:14)\r\n31. Blessed be all those prophets who say to the people of Christ, \u201cCross, cross,'' and there is no cross!\u2028\r\n32. Christians should be exhorted to be diligent in following Christ, their Head, through penalties, death and hell.\u2028\r\n33.

Then a statement somewhat in detail of a course to be pursued seemed fitting and proper. Now, at the expiration of four years, during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation, little that is new could be presented. The progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as well known to the public as to myself, and it is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all. With high hope for the future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured.\n\nOn the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war. All dreaded it, all sought to avert it. While the inaugural address was being delivered from this place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war, insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war\u2014seeking to dissolve the Union and divide effects by negotiation. Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came.\r\n      One-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the southern part of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war.\n\nTo strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union even by war, while the Government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it. Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained. Neither anticipated that the causeof the conflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should cease. Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces, but let us judge not, that we be not judged. The prayers of both could not be answered. That of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes.\n\n\"Woe unto the world because of offenses; for it must needs be that offenses come, but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh.\" If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued through His appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that He gives to both North and South this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living God always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away.\n\nYet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said \"the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.\" \r\n     With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations."},{"title":"Raymond's Run","author":"Toni Cade Bambara","year":"1990","category":"book","content":"I don\u2019t have much work to do around the house like some girls.

We carry the baskets high on our hips. We juggle the soap, the scrub board, and clips.\r\n      River--age stones to the other side. Where sunrays glimmer on a whisper of shade. And Mami and me tie our hair up in braids.\r\n       Then WHACK! I smack the clothes on the rocks to scare out all dirt and grassy spots. Mami scrubs them up and down, and we both swirl them round and round.\r\n       Sparkling white, and river clean the clothes smell like fresh-air dreams. We clip them safe to bushes and trees to dry in the sun and flap in the breeze. Later, under the moon's blue light Mami and me smooth the wrinkled clothes right. We fold them into neat little squares and take them back home for all to wear.\n\nWashday was the day I\u2019d get Maim all to myself. For me it was the best day of the week. Unless it rained. Then I'd have to keep on sharing Mami with everyone, especially Papi, who sat on the porch and never moved. Mami had no time to pat her hair down, let alone share private thoughts the way we did on washday.\r\n      At the river's edge, I'd tell Mami all the special things I had thought about during the week. If I wrote a new poem, I would recite it to her while we dipped our hands into the cool water. It was just me and her and the river. No other hands, no other ears.\r\n     Mami was the only person who knew I wanted to write books when I grew up. I knew it was a strange thing to want to do, because we sure didn't know any writers around here. In fact, Papi told me that in the Republic Dominicana, only the President could write books.\n\nI think it's true. I went to the libreria and I saw a lot of books by President Balaguer. I told Mami this during one washday. We were pounding the clothes with rocks, and I gripped mine hard as I beat the dirt out of Papi's overalls and my brother Guario's waiter uniforms.\r\n      Mami didn't say anything. She just kept turning her sheet over and over as she pounded away. Finally she looked up and said, \u201cAna Rosa, there always has to be a first person to do something.\u201d\r\n      I think Mami was telling me that there was no reason why I couldn't try and be the first writer who wasn't President of our Island. Either that or she was hinting that I should run for President, and then if I won I could write what I wanted.\n\nSometimes Mami's words are a puzzle. I have to spin them around and around in my head as if I am doing a mental merengue. Sooner or later I figure out the dance, but sometimes I wish she would just say what she means straight out.\r\n     Papi might sound as if he is talking in a puzzle, but I always know exactly what he means. Like when I asked him if I could have a notebook just for writing my poems in. He said, \u201cMuchacha, your head is getting bigger than your hat.\u201d\r\n      When I told Mami this on our next washday, she laughed. But I could tell the laugh was only in her throat and not in her heart.\r\n      \u201cYour papi says funny things sometimes, carino,\u201d she said. \u201cHe's a dreamer.\u201d\r\n      \u201cA dreamer?\u201d I asked. \u201cHow can you say that, Mami? All Papi does is sit on the porch and drink rum.\u201d\n\nMami's hand shot out faster than a lizard under a rock. I felt the pain on my cheek before I realized what had happened. \u201cYou have no hair on your tongue, chica. Be careful!\u201d I swallowed my tears and beat the clothes harder. Washday had never been a day of sharp words and slaps. I felt as if Papi was a rock falling down from the hills and into our river. After the big splash, there was nothing but silence. In daylight, silence is louder and angrier than at any other time. There are no sweet measures of silence such as night's stars, or evening's sunset, or morning's growing light. There is only bright, hard silence and it sounds louder than drums.\r\n      I glanced over at Mami. She was dipping the clothes into the river. \u201cLook, Ana Rosa,\u201d she said. \u201cLook at the river.\u201d\n\nI looked. The water rushed around Mami's brown knees and through her blistered red fingers, leaving wet kisses on her skin.\r\n\u201cIt'll never pass this way again,\u201d she said. \u201cOff it will go down to the sea, where it will foam with the waves and swim with the fish and glide ships along on steady or rough courses depending on its mood. Around and around the world it will go, this water that slips by me so quickly. Far from the Republic Dominicana, far from me, but always under the same sky and sun.\u201d\r\n      I had never heard Mami say so much at one time. I looked closely at the river but I could not see all that she saw in it.\r\n      \u201cYou are this river, Ana Rosa,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut you must flow softly around the rocks on your way to meet the sea. There you can do as you wish.\u201d\n\nMami's words were gentle. But her brown eyes were slits of worry like moon slices on a dark night. There was no happiness in the smile she gave me.\r\n      Many days and nights I thought about Mami's words. But no matter how I turned them or shook them or chased them from my mind, they always came back telling me the same thing.

The great poets like Ghalib, Rumi, Iqbal\u2014they had things to say.\u201d\r\n \t\u201cAnd don\u2019t you have things to say?\u201d\r\n \t\u201cWhat would I write about?\u201d I laughed. \u201cMy little sisters? My father\u2019s sugarcane fields and orange groves? I love reading poems, but there\u2019s nothing for me to really write about. Our life is boring.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true! Write about what you see! Write about your dreams. Pakistan was founded by the dreams of poets. Aren\u2019t we of the same earth?\u201d\r\n      Miss Sadia\u2019s dramatic way of talking was one of the reasons I loved her, but I wasn\u2019t convinced. It\u2019s not that I wasn\u2019t proud of my family and our life. I was lucky to belong to one of the more prosperous families in our Punjabi village but it didn\u2019t change the fact that I lived in a village so tiny, it didn\u2019t even register as a dot on a map.\r\n \tBut I promised I\u2019d talk to Hafsa.\r\n \tThis is what I now remember most about my last afternoon at school\u2014the smell of the dusty chalkboard, the sound of the students lingering outside the door, and mostly, how easily I took my ordinary life for granted.\n\nI raced down the school\u2019s gravel walkway to catch up to Seema and Hafsa. The sun blazed overhead, warming my chador and my hair beneath it.\r\n \t\u201cI\u2019m buying Miss Sadia one of those bells I see on TV. You know, the kind that rings when class is over?\u201d Hafsa grumbled.\r\n \t\u201cShe doesn\u2019t always keep us late,\u201d I protested.\r\n \t\u201cRemember last week?\u201d Hafsa said. \u201cHow she went on and on about constellations? By the time I got home, my brothers were out of their school clothes and halfway through their homework.\u201d\r\n \t\u201cBut wasn\u2019t it interesting?\u201d I asked. \u201cThe way the night stars help us when we\u2019re lost and tell all sorts of different stories?\u201d\r\n \t\u201cWhy do I need to know about connecting dots in the sky? I want to be the first doctor in my family. Not the first astronaut,\u201d Hafsa said.\n\nHafsa and I had been friends so long, I couldn\u2019t remember a time I didn\u2019t know her, but when she talked like this, I didn\u2019t understand her at all. Unlike Hafsa, I wanted to know everything there was to know. How fast did airplanes fly? Why did some leave whiffs of clouds in their wake and others didn\u2019t? Where did ladybugs go when the rain came hard and fast? What was it like to walk through the streets of Paris, or New York, or Karachi? There was so much I didn\u2019t know that even if I spent my whole life trying, I knew I could only learn a small percentage of it.\r\n \t\u201cHow\u2019s your mom?\u201d Hafsa asked. \u201cMy mother said her back is hurting.\u201d\r\n \t\u201cIt\u2019s gotten worse,\u201d I told her. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t get out of bed yesterday.\u201d\r\n\t\u201cMy mother said that\u2019s a good sign. Backaches mean a boy,\u201d Hafsa said. \u201cI know that would make your parents happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be fun to have a brother,\u201d I said.\r\n      \u201cThere it is! Look at the door!\u201d Hafsa said when we turned the bend toward our homes. She pointed to the building that had appeared next to our village mosque. A structure had never emerged quite like this before with no explanation. Two weeks ago, a concrete foundation had been poured onto the field where we played soccer. The next week, brick walls arose and windows appeared, and today there was a door\u2014painted lime green!\r\n \t\u201cAny idea yet what it could be?\u201d I asked her.\r\n \t\u201cYes.\u201d Hafsa grinned. If Hafsa could have it her way, she\u2019d be permanently stationed by the crates of fruit at her family\u2019s market, soaking up every bit of gossip. \u201cKhan Sahib is building a factory.\u201d\n\nI rolled my eyes. Rumors and gossip were a part of life in our village. Some of the talk was ordinary, about the state of the crops or the weather, but often it centered on Khan Sahib, our village\u2019s powerful landlord.\r\n\t\u201cWhy would he build a factory here? He has plenty in Islamabad and Lahore,\u201d Seema said. What we need is a clinic. Look how much Amma\u2019s back hurts. The doctor in town is good, but this village needs a proper clinic.\u201d\r\n \t\u201cDo you really think Khan Sahib would put up anything to help us?\u201d Hafsa scoffed.\r\n \t\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not him building it,\u201d I suggested.\r\n \t\u201cLook at the fancy green door! Who else has time and money to waste like that? You know I\u2019m right.\u201d\r\n \tAny unexplainable situation was always pinned to Khan Sahib. He was the mysterious figure I\u2019d heard of all my life but never seen. When I was younger, he loomed large and scary, like a character in a horror story.\n\n\u201cSure! He\u2019s the one who breathes fire when he talks, right?\u201d I rolled my eyes.\r\n \t\u201cDidn\u2019t he pick all the fruit off Naima\u2019s guava tree?\u201d Seema winked.\r\n\u201cI heard he\u2019s why we\u2019ve had no rain for months,\u201d I continued.\r\n \t\u201cI don\u2019t decide what I hear,\u201d Hafsa huffed. \u201cI just report it.\u201d\r\n \t\u201cWe\u2019ll find out what it is soon enough.\u201d I hooked my arm through Seema\u2019s. \u201cBut in the meantime, let\u2019s hope it\u2019s a clinic.\u201d\r\n \tHafsa\u2019s house came first on our path, just past the post office. Then came mine. I saw it in the distance. Gray like the others surrounding it except for the roses my mother planted around its border just before I was born; they still bloomed each spring around this time, without fail. It\u2019s why spring was my favorite time of year.\n\nMy friend Omar peddled past us in his blue and khaki school uniform. He chimed his bell three times, our signal to meet. The stream. That\u2019s the direction he was headed in.\r\n\u201cOh no.\u201d I looked in my book bag. \u201cI left my exam in class.\u201d\r\n \t\u201cAgain?\u201d Hafsa frowned.\r\n \t\u201cTell Amma I won\u2019t be long?\u201d I asked Seema.\r\n \tSeema hesitated. Our father would be home soon, but she knew Omar didn\u2019t chime his bicycle bell three times unless it was important.\r\n \t\u201cOkay.\u201d Seema nodded. \u201cHurry.\u201d"},{"title":"To Kill a Mockingbird","author":"Harper Lee","year":"1964","category":"book","content":"When my father was admitted to the bar, he returned to Maycomb and began his  practice. Maycomb, some twenty miles east of Finch\u2019s Landing, was the county  seat of Maycomb County. Atticus\u2019s office in the courthouse contained little more  than a hat rack, a spittoon, a checkerboard and an unsullied Code of Alabama. His  first two clients were the last two persons hanged in the Maycomb County jail.  Atticus had urged them to accept the state\u2019s generosity in allowing them to plead  Guilty to second-degree murder and escape with their lives, but they were  Haverfords, in Maycomb County a name synonymous with jackass. The  Haverfords had dispatched Maycomb\u2019 s leading blacksmith in a misunderstanding  arising from the alleged wrongful detention of a mare, were imprudent enough to  do it in the presence of three witnesses, and insisted that the-son-of-a-bitch-had-it-coming-to-him was a good enough defense for anybody.\n\nThey persisted in  pleading Not Guilty to first-degree murder, so there was nothing much Atticus  could do for his clients except be present at their departure, an occasion that was  probably the beginning of my father\u2019s profound distaste for the practice of criminal law. \r\n      During his first five years in Maycomb, Atticus practiced economy more than  anything; for several years thereafter he invested his earnings in his brother\u2019s  education. John Hale Finch was ten years younger than my father, and chose to  study medicine at a time when cotton was not worth growing; but after getting  Uncle Jack started, Atticus derived a reasonable income from the law. He liked  Maycomb, he was Maycomb County born and bred; he knew his people, they  knew him, and because of Simon Finch\u2019s industry, Atticus was related by blood  or marriage to nearly every family in the town.\n\nMaycomb was an old town, but it was a tired old town when I first knew it. In rainy weather the streets turned to red slop; grass grew on the sidewalks, the courthouse sagged in the square. Somehow, it was hotter then: a black dog suffered on a summer\u2019s day; bony mules hitched to Hoover carts flicked flies in the sweltering shade of the live oaks on the square. Men\u2019s stiff collars wilted by nine in the morning. Ladies bathed before noon, after their three-o\u2019clock naps,  and by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum.\n\nPeople moved slowly then. They ambled across the square, shuffled in and out of  the stores around it, took their time about everything. A day was twenty-four  hours long but seemed longer. There was no hurry, for there was nowhere to go,  nothing to buy and no money to buy it with, nothing to see outside the boundaries  of May comb County. But it was a time of vague optimism for some of the people:  Maycomb County had recently been told that it had nothing to fear but fear itself."},{"title":"Heart of Darkness","author":"Joseph Conrad","year":"1899","category":"prose","content":"The Nellie, a cruising yawl, swung to her anchor without a flutter of the sails, and was at rest. The flood had made, the wind was nearly calm, and being bound down the river, the only thing for it was to come to and wait for the turn of the tide.\r\n      The sea-reach of the Thames stretched before us like the beginning of an interminable waterway. In the offing the sea and the sky were welded together without a joint, and in the luminous space the tanned sails of the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand still in red clusters of canvas sharply peaked, with gleams of varnished sprits. A haze rested on the low shores that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness. The air was dark above Gravesend, and farther back still seemed condensed into a mournful gloom, brooding motionless over the biggest, and the greatest, town on earth.\n\nThe Director of Companies was our captain and our host. We four affectionately watched his back as he stood in the bows looking to seaward. On the whole river there was nothing that looked half so nautical. He resembled a pilot, which to a seaman is trustworthiness personified. It was difficult to realize his work was not out there in the luminous estuary, but behind him, within the brooding gloom.\r\nBetween us there was, as I have already said somewhere, the bond of the sea. Besides holding our hearts together through long periods of separation, it had the effect of making us tolerant of each other's yarns\u2014and even convictions. The Lawyer\u2014the best of old fellows\u2014had, because of his many years and many virtues, the only cushion on deck, and was lying on the only rug.\n\nThe Accountant had brought out already a box of dominoes, and was toying architecturally with the bones. Marlow sat cross-legged right aft, leaning against the mizzen-mast. He had sunken cheeks, a yellow complexion, a straight back, an ascetic aspect, and, with his arms dropped, the palms of hands outwards, resembled an idol.  The director, satisfied the anchor had good hold, made his way aft and sat down amongst us. We exchanged a few words lazily. Afterwards there was silence on board the yacht. For some reason or other we did not begin that game of dominoes. We felt meditative, and fit for nothing but placid staring. The day was ending in a serenity of still and exquisite brilliance. The water shone pacifically; the sky, without a speck, was a benign immensity of unstained light; the very mist on the Essex marsh was like a gauzy and radiant fabric, hung from the wooded rises inland, and draping the low shores in diaphanous folds.\n\nOnly the gloom to the west, brooding over the upper reaches, became more sombre every minute, as if angered by the approach of the sun.\r\n      And at last, in its curved and imperceptible fall, the sun sank low, and from glowing white changed to a dull red without rays and without heat, as if about to go out suddenly, stricken to death by the touch of that gloom brooding over a crowd of men.\r\n      Forthwith a change came over the waters, and the serenity became less brilliant but more profound. The old river in its broad reach rested unruffled at the decline of day, after ages of good service done to the race that peopled its banks, spread out in the tranquil dignity of a waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth. We looked at the venerable stream not in the vivid flush of a short day that comes and departs for ever, but in the august light of abiding memories.\n\nAnd indeed nothing is easier for a man who has, as the phrase goes, \u201cfollowed the sea\u201d with reverence and affection, than to evoke the great spirit of the past upon the lower reaches of the Thames. The tidal current runs to and fro in its unceasing service, crowded with memories of men and ships it had borne to the rest of home or to the battles of the sea. It had known and served all the men of whom the nation is proud, from Sir Francis Drake to Sir John Franklin, knights all, titled and untitled\u2014the great knights-errant of the sea. It had borne all the ships whose names are like jewels flashing in the night of time, from the Golden Hind returning with her rotund flanks full of treasure, to be visited by the Queen's Highness and thus pass out of the gigantic tale, to the Erebus and Terror, bound on other conquests\u2014and that never returned. It had known the ships and the men.\n\nThey had sailed from Deptford, from Greenwich, from Erith\u2014the adventurers and the settlers; kings' ships and the ships of men on 'Change; captains, admirals, the dark \u201cinterlopers\u201d of the Eastern trade, and the commissioned \u201cgenerals\u201d of East India fleets. Hunters for gold or pursuers of fame, they all had gone out on that stream, bearing the sword, and often the torch, messengers of the might within the land, bearers of a spark from the sacred fire. What greatness had not floated on the ebb of that river into the mystery of an unknown earth!... The dreams of men, the seed of commonwealths, the germs of empires. \r\n     The sun set; the dusk fell on the stream, and lights began to appear along the shore. The Chapman light-house, a three-legged thing erect on a mud-flat, shone strongly. Lights of ships moved in the fairway\u2014a great stir of lights going up and going down.\n\nAnd farther west on the upper reaches the place of the monstrous town was still marked ominously on the sky, a brooding gloom in sunshine, a lurid glare under the stars.\r\n     \u201cAnd this also,\u201d said Marlow suddenly, \u201chas been one of the dark places of the earth.\u201d"},{"title":"The Things They Carried","author":"Tim O'Brien","year":"1990","category":"book","content":"Almost everyone humped photographs. In his wallet, Lieutenant Cross carried two photographs of Martha. The first was a Kodacolor snapshot signed Love, though he knew better. She stood against a brick wall. Her eyes were gray and neutral, her lips slightly open as she stared straighton at the camera. At night, sometimes, Lieutenant Cross wondered who had taken the picture, because he knew she had boyfriends, because he loved her so much, and because he could see the shadow of the picturetaker spreading out against the brick wall. The second photograph had been clipped from the 1968 Mount Sebastian yearbook. It was an action shot\u2014women's volleyball\u2014and Martha was bent horizontal to the floor, reaching, the palms of her hands in sharp focus, the tongue taut, the expression frank and competitive. There was no visible sweat. She wore white gym shorts.\n\nHer legs, he thought, were almost certainly the legs of a virgin, dry and without hair, the left knee cocked and carrying her entire weight, which was just over 100 pounds. Lieutenant Cross remembered touching that left knee. A dark theater, he remembered, and the movie was Bonnie and Clyde, and Martha wore a tweed skirt, and during the final scene, when he touched her knee, she turned and looked at him in a sad, sober way that made him pull his hand back, but he would always remember the feel of the tweed skirt and the knee beneath it and the sound of the gunfire that killed Bonnie and Clyde, how embarrassing it was, how slow and oppressive. He remembered kissing her good night at the dorm door. Right then, he thought, he should've done something brave. He should've carried her up the stairs to her room and tied her to the bed and touched that left knee all night long.\n\nHe should've risked it. Whenever he looked at the photographs, he thought of new things he should've done. \r\n     As PFCs or Spec 4s, most of them were common grunts and carried the standard M-16 gas-operated assault rifle. The weapon weighed 7.5 pounds unloaded, 8.2 pounds with its full 20-round magazine. Depending on numerous factors, such as topography and psychology, the riflemen carried anywhere from 12 to 20 magazines, usually in cloth bandoliers, adding on another 8.4 pounds at minimum, 14 pounds at maximum. When it was available, they also carried M-16 maintenance gear\u2014rods and steel brushes and swabs and tubes of LSA oil\u2014all of which weighed about a pound. Among the grunts, some carried the M-79 grenade launcher, 5.9 pounds unloaded, a reasonably light weapon except for the ammunition, which was heavy. A single round weighed 10 ounces.\n\nThe typical load was 25 rounds. But Ted Lavender, who was scared, carried 34 rounds when he was shot and killed outside Than Khe, and he went down under an exceptional burden, more than 20 pounds of ammunition, plus the flak jacket and helmet and rations and water and toilet paper and tranquilizers and all the rest, plus the unweighed fear. He was dead weight. There was no twitching or flopping. Kiowa, who saw it happen, said it was like watching a rock fall, or a big sandbag or something\u2014just boom, then down\u2014not like the movies where the dead guy rolls around and does fancy spins and goes ass over teakettle\u2014not like that, Kiowa said, the poor bastard just flat-fuck fell. Boom. Down. Nothing else. It was a bright morning in mid-April. Lieutenant Cross felt the pain. He blamed himself.\n\nThey stripped off Lavender's canteens and ammo, all the heavy things, and Rat Kiley said the obvious, the guy's dead, and Mitchell Sanders used his radio to report one U.S. KIA and to request a chopper. Then they wrapped Lavender in his poncho. They Christine Taylor Riendeau Thursday, February 16, 2012 11:56:25 AM ET carried him out to a dry paddy, established security, and sat smoking the dead man's dope until the chopper came. Lieutenant Cross kept to himself. He pictured Martha's smooth young face, thinking he loved her more than anything, more than his men, and now Ted Lavender was dead because he loved her so much and could not stop thinking about her. When the dustoff arrived, they carried Lavender aboard. Afterward they burned Than Khe. They marched until dusk, then dug their holes, and that night Kiowa kept explaining how you had to be there, how fast it was, how the poor guy just dropped like so much concrete. Boom-down, he said. Like cement."},{"title":"Speaking of Courage","author":"Tim O'Brien","year":"1990","category":"book","content":"Norman Bowker's letter hit me hard. For years I'd felt a certain smugness about how easily I had made the shift from war to peace. A nice smooth glide\u2014no flashbacks or midnight sweats. The war was over, after all. And the thing to do was go on. So I took pride in sliding gracefully from Vietnam to graduate school, from Chu Lai to Harvard, from one world to another. In ordinary conversation I never spoke much about the war, certainly not in detail, and yet ever since my return I had been talking about it virtually nonstop through my writing. Telling Christine Taylor Riendeau Thursday, February 16, 2012 11:56:25 AM ET stories seemed a natural, inevitable process, like clearing the throat. Partly catharsis, partly communication, it was a way of grabbing people by the shirt and explaining exactly what had happened to me, how I'd allowed myself to get dragged into a wrong war, all the mistakes I'd made, all the terrible things I had seen and done.\n\nI did not look on my work as therapy, and still don't. Yet when I received Norman Bowker's letter, it occurred to me that the act of writing had led me through a swirl of memories that might otherwise have ended in paralysis or worse. By telling stories, you objectify your own experience. You separate it from yourself. You pin down certain truths. You make up others. You start sometimes with an incident that truly happened, like the night in the shit field, and you carry it forward by inventing incidents that did not in fact occur but that nonetheless help to clarify and explain. \r\n    In any case, Norman Bowker's letter had an effect. It haunted me for more than a month, not the words so much as its desperation, and I resolved finally to take him up on his story suggestion.\n\nAt the time I was at work on a new novel, Going After Cacciato, and one morning I sat down and began a chapter titled \"Speaking of Courage.\" The emotional core came directly from Bowker's letter: the simple need to talk. To provide a dramatic frame, I collapsed events into a single time and place, a car circling a lake on a quiet afternoon in midsummer, using the lake as a nucleus around which the story would orbit. As he'd requested, I did not use Norman Bowker's name, instead substituting the name of my novel's main character, Paul Berlin. For the scenery I borrowed heavily from my own hometown. Wholesale thievery, in fact. I lifted up Worthington, Minnesota\u2014the lake, the road, the causeway, the woman in pedal pushers, the junior college, the handsome houses and docks and boats and public parks\u2014and carried it all a few hundred miles south and transplanted it onto the Iowa prairie."},{"title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass","author":"Frederick Douglass","year":"1845","category":"autobiography","content":"Our house stood within a few rods of the Chesapeake Bay, whose broad bosom was ever white with sails from every quarter of the habitable globe. Those beautiful vessels, robed in purest white, so delightful to the eye of freemen, were to me so many shrouded ghosts, to terrify and torment me with thoughts of my wretched condition. I have often, in the deep stillness of a summer's Sabbath, stood all alone upon the lofty banks of that noble bay, and traced, with saddened heart and tearful eye, the countless number of sails moving off to the mighty ocean. The sight of these always affected me powerfully. My thoughts would compel utterance; and there, with no audience but the Almighty, I would pour out my soul's complaint, in my rude way, with an apostrophe to the moving multitude of ships:\u2014\r\n     \"You are loosed from your moorings, and are free; I am fast in my chains, and am a slave! You move merrily before the gentle gale, and I sadly before the bloody whip!\n\nYou are freedom's swift-winged angels, that fly round the world;  I am confined in bands of iron! O that I were free! O, that I were on one of your gallant decks, and under your protecting wing! Alas! betwixt me and you, the turbid waters roll. Go on, go on. O that I could also go! Could I but swim! If I could fly! O, why was I born a man, of whom to make a brute! The glad ship is gone; she hides in the dim distance. I am left in the hottest hell of unending slavery. O God, save me! God, deliver me! Let me be free! Is there any God? Why am I a slave? I will run away. I will not stand it. Get caught, or get clear, I'll try it. I had as well die with ague as the fever. I have only one life to lose. I had as well be killed running as die standing. Only think of it; one hundred miles straight north, and I am free! Try it? Yes! God helping me, I will. It cannot be that I shall live and die a slave. I will take to the water. This very bay shall yet bear me into freedom.\n\nThe steamboats steered in a north-east course from North Point.  I will do the same; and when I get to the head of the bay, I will turn my canoe adrift, and walk straight through Delaware into Pennsylvania. When I get there, I shall not be required to have a pass; I can travel without being disturbed. Let but the first opportunity offer, and, come what will, I am off. Meanwhile, I will try to bear up under the yoke. I am not the only slave in the world. Why should I fret? I can bear as much as any of them. Besides, I am but a boy, and all boys are bound to some one. It may be that my misery in slavery will only increase my happiness when I get free. There is a better day coming.\" Thus I used to think, and thus I used to speak to myself; goaded almost to madness at one moment, and at the next reconciling myself to my wretched lot. I have already intimated that my condition was much worse, during the first six months of my stay at Mr. Covey's, than in the last six.\n\nThe circumstances leading to the change in Mr. Covey's course toward me form an epoch in my humble history. You have seen how a man was made a slave; you shall see how a slave was made a man. On one of the hottest days of the month of August, 1833, Bill Smith, William Hughes, a slave named Eli, and myself, were engaged in fanning wheat. Hughes was clearing the fanned wheat from before the fan. Eli was turning, Smith was feeding, and I was carrying wheat to the fan. The work was simple, requiring strength rather than intellect; yet, to one entirely unused to such work, it came very hard.\n\nAbout three o'clock of that day, I broke down; my strength failed me; I was seized with a violent aching of the head, attended with extreme dizziness; I trembled in every limb. Finding what was coming, I nerved myself up, feeling it would never do to stop work. I stood as long as I could stagger to the hopper with grain. When I could stand no longer, I fell, and felt as if held down by an immense weight. The fan of course stopped; every one had his own work to do; and no one could do the work of the other, and have his own go on at the same time."},{"title":"Pride and Prejudice","author":"Jane Austen","year":"1813","category":"book","content":"As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked.  It was gratitude:\n\nGratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude\u2014for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; And she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to...\n\ndepend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses. It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's in coming to see them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.  Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon."},{"title":"Great Expectations","author":"Charles Dickens","year":"1861","category":"book","content":"As I had asked for a night-light, the chamberlain had brought me in, before he left me, the good old constitutional rushlight of those virtuous days\u2014an object like the ghost of a walking-cane, which instantly broke its back if it were touched, which nothing could ever be lighted at, and which was placed in solitary confinement at the bottom of a high tin tower, perforated with round holes that made a staringly wide-awake pattern on the walls. When I had got into bed, and lay there footsore, weary, and wretched, I found that I could no more close my own eyes than I could close the eyes of this foolish Argus. And thus, in the gloom and death of the night, we stared at one another.\r\n     What a doleful night! How anxious, how dismal, how long!\n\nThere was an inhospitable smell in the room, of cold soot and hot dust; and, as I looked up into the corners of the tester over my head, I thought what a number of blue-bottle flies from the butchers', and earwigs from the market, and grubs from the country, must be holding on up there, lying by for next summer. This led me to speculate whether any of them ever tumbled down, and then I fancied that I felt light falls on my face,\u2014a disagreeable turn of thought, suggesting other and more objectionable approaches up my back. When I had lain awake a little while, those extraordinary voices with which silence teems began to make themselves audible. The closet whispered, the fireplace sighed, the little washing-stand ticked, and one guitar-string played occasionally in the chest of drawers. At about the same time, the eyes on the wall acquired a new expression, and in every one of those staring rounds I saw written, DON'T GO HOME.\n\nWhatever night-fancies and night-noises crowded on me, they never warded off this DON'T GO HOME. It plaited itself into whatever I thought of, as a bodily pain would have done. Not long before, I had read in the newspapers, how a gentleman unknown had come to the Hummums in the night, and had gone to bed, and had destroyed himself, and had been found in the morning weltering in blood. It came into my head that he must have occupied this very vault of mine, and I got out of bed to assure myself that there were no red marks about; then opened the door to look out into the passages, and cheer myself with the companionship of a distant light, near which I knew the chamberlain to be dozing. But all this time, why I was not to go home, and what had happened at home, and when I should go home, and whether Provis was safe at home, were questions occupying my mind so busily, that one might have supposed there could be no more room in it for any other theme.\n\nEven when I thought of Estella, and how we had parted that day forever, and when I recalled all the circumstances of our parting, and all her looks and tones, and the action of her fingers while she knitted,\u2014even then I was pursuing, here and there and everywhere, the caution, Don't go home. When at last I dozed, in sheer exhaustion of mind and body, it became a vast shadowy verb which I had to conjugate. Imperative mood, present tense: Do not thou go home, let him not go home, let us not go home, do not ye or you go home, let not them go home. Then potentially: I may not and I cannot go home; and I might not, could not, would not, and should not go home; until I felt that I was going distracted, and rolled over on the pillow, and looked at the staring rounds upon the wall again.\n\nI had left directions that I was to be called at seven; for it was plain that I must see Wemmick before seeing any one else, and equally plain that this was a case in which his Walworth sentiments only could be taken. It was a relief to get out of the room where the night had been so miserable, and I needed no second knocking at the door to startle me from my uneasy bed."},{"title":"Jane Eyre \u2022 Selection 2","author":"Charlotte Bront\u00eb","year":"1847","category":"book","content":"Again I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its low broad tower against the sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a narrow galaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a village or hamlet.  About ten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair of gates: we passed through, and they clashed to behind us.  We now slowly ascended a drive, and came upon the long front of a house: candlelight gleamed from one curtained bow-window; all the rest were dark.  The car stopped at the front door; it was opened by a maid-servant; I alighted and went in.\r\n\u201cWill you walk this way, ma\u2019am?\u201d said the girl; and I followed her across a square hall with high doors all round: she ushered me into a room whose double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me, contrasting as it did with the darkness to which my eyes had been for two hours inured;\n\nWhen I could see, however, a cosy and agreeable picture presented itself to my view.\r\n     A snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an arm-chair high-backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable little elderly lady, in widow\u2019s cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron; exactly like what I had fancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately and milder looking.  She was occupied in knitting; a large cat sat demurely at her feet; nothing in short was wanting to complete the beau-ideal of domestic comfort.  A more reassuring introduction for a new governess could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to overwhelm, no stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the old lady got up and promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.\n\n\u201cHow do you do, my dear?  I am afraid you have had a tedious ride; John drives so slowly; you must be cold, come to the fire.\u201d\r\n\u201cMrs. Fairfax, I suppose?\u201d said I.\r\n\u201cYes, you are right: do sit down.\u201d\r\nShe conducted me to her own chair, and then began to remove my shawl and untie my bonnet-strings; I begged she would not give herself so much trouble.\r\n\u201cOh, it is no trouble; I dare say your own hands are almost numbed with cold.  Leah, make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two: here are the keys of the storeroom.\u201d\r\nAnd she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch of keys, and delivered them to the servant.\r\n\u201cNow, then, draw nearer to the fire,\u201d she continued.  \u201cYou\u2019ve brought your luggage with you, haven\u2019t you, my dear?\u201d\r\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll see it carried into your room,\u201d she said, and bustled out.\r\n\u201cShe treats me like a visitor,\u201d thought I.  \u201cI little expected such a reception; I anticipated only coldness and stiffness: this is not like what I have heard of the treatment of governesses; but I must not exult too soon.\u201d\r\n      She returned; with her own hands cleared her knitting apparatus and a book or two from the table, to make room for the tray which Leah now brought, and then herself handed me the refreshments.  I felt rather confused at being the object of more attention than I had ever before received, and, that too, shown by my employer and superior; but as she did not herself seem to consider she was doing anything out of her place, I thought it better to take her civilities quietly.\n\n\u201cShall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax to-night?\u201d I asked, when I had partaken of what she offered me.\r\n\u201cWhat did you say, my dear?  I am a little deaf,\u201d returned the good lady, approaching her ear to my mouth.\r\nI repeated the question more distinctly.\r\n\u201cMiss Fairfax?  Oh, you mean Miss Varens!  Varens is the name of your future pupil.\u201d\r\n\u201cIndeed!

He gorged himself habitually at table, which made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks.  He ought now to have been at school; but his mama had taken him home for a month or two, \u201con account of his delicate health.\u201d  Mr. Miles, the master, affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats sent him from home; but the mother\u2019s heart turned from an opinion so harsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that John\u2019s sallowness was owing to over-application and, perhaps, to pining after home.\n\nJohn had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an antipathy to me.  He bullied and punished me; not two or three times in the week, nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I had feared him, and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near.  There were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he inspired, because I had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his inflictions; the servants did not like to offend their young master by taking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf on the subject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though he did both now and then in her very presence, more frequently, however, behind her back.\r\n     Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some three minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without damaging the roots:\n\nI knew he would soon strike, and while dreading the blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would presently deal it.  I wonder if he read that notion in my face; for, all at once, without speaking, he struck suddenly and strongly.  I tottered, and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his chair.\r\n      \u201cThat is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since,\u201d said he, \u201cand for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the look you had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!\u201d\r\nAccustomed to John Reed\u2019s abuse, I never had an idea of replying to it; my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the insult.\r\n\u201cWhat were you doing behind the curtain?\u201d he asked. \u201cI was reading.\u201d\r\n\u201cShow the book.\u201d\r\nI returned to the window and fetched it thence.\n\n\u201cYou have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mama says; you have no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg, and not to live here with gentlemen\u2019s children like us, and eat the same meals we do, and wear clothes at our mama\u2019s expense.  Now, I\u2019ll teach you to rummage my bookshelves: for they are mine; all the house belongs to me, or will do in a few years.  Go and stand by the door, out of the way of the mirror and the windows.\u201d\r\nI did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when I saw him lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough, however; the volume was flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head against the door and cutting it.  The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my terror had passed its climax; other feelings succeeded. \u201cWicked and cruel boy!\u201d I said.  \u201cYou are like a murderer\u2014you are like a slave-driver\u2014you are like the Roman emperors!\u201d"},{"title":"The Crucible","author":"Arthur Miller","year":"1953","category":"performance","content":"Mary Warren: Abby, we\u2019ve got to tell.

The days before and the days after the first World War are separated not like the end of an old and the beginning of a new period, but like the day before and the day after an explosion. Yet this figure of speech is as inaccurate as are all others, because the quiet of sorrow which settles down after a catastrophe has never come to pass. The first explosion seems to have touched off a chain reaction in which we have been caught ever since and which nobody seems to be able to stop. he first World War exploded the European comity of nations beyond repair, something which no other war had ever done.\n\nInflation destroyed the whole class of small property owners beyond hope for recovery or new formation, something which no monetary crisis had ever done so radically before. Unemployment, which it came, reached fabulous proportions was no longer restricted to the working class but seized with insignificant exceptions whole nations.\r\n\r\nCivil wars which ushered in and spread over the twenty years of uneasy peace were not only bloodier and more cruel than all their predecessors; they were followed by migrations of groups who, unlike their happier predecessors in the religious wars, were welcomed nowhere and could be assimilated nowhere.\n\nOnce they had left their homeland they remained homeless, once they had left their state they became stateless; once they had been deprived of their human rights they were rightness, the scum of the earth. Nothing which was being done, no matter how stupid, no matter how many people knew and foretold the consequences, could be undone or prevented.

Grismer","year":"1932","category":"prose","content":"The village of Franklin Mills undoubtedly owed its existence to the Cuyahoga River, for it was this river, rushing and roaring through the narrow gorge above and below the present Crain Avenue bridge, which provided the water-power needed for the operation of grist and saw mills. As was the case throughout the entire Western Reserve, mills were built where waterpower existed, and where mills were built, there sprang up some of the most thriving settlements. The first person who sensed the possibilities of the river was Jacob Haymaker, a millwright and carpenter of German descent who prospected through the county in the spring of 1805, seeking a home site in the vast and practically unsettled wilderness.\n\nDuring the long winter which followed, the Haymakers\u2019 only visitors were Indians who came from their villages at Silver Lake and Cuyahoga Falls to see how white people lived. One day a squaw who came to visit took her papoose from her hack and stood the board to which it was attached against the hut. While she was inside talking to Mrs. Haymaker a wild hog came along, grabbed the baby, and ran helter-skelter through the underbrush. The squaw managed to rescue her baby but only after a hard fight with the animal.\n\nWith the coming of peace, the people of Franklin Township looked to the future with renewed hope. They were further encouraged by the occasional arrival of new neighbors. One of the newcomers was Elisha Stevens who bought a small tract of land on the west side of the river, near the present intersection of River and Mantua Streets, and erected a sawmill, to be operated by horsepower. Up to this time, very little timber was used except in the rough. As soon as Stevens had his mill in operation, the settlers were able, for the first time, to construct frame houses.\n\nAn event of unusual importance occurred on August 10, 1814. Franklin Township celebrated its first wedding! Neighbors from miles around gathered at noon at the home of Adam and Betsey Nighman to witness the marriage of their daughter Theresa to Christian Cackler, of Hudson, who had volunteered in the War of 1812 and had taken part in Perry\u2019s victorious engagement. After the ceremony was performed, the wedding dinner was served\u2014a substantial backwoods feast of beef, fowl and deer meat, together with as many different vegetables as could be procured. Following the dinner there was a dance which lasted into the small hours of the morning."},{"title":"The Sculptor","author":"William Donohue Ellis","year":"1966","category":"book","content":"Even a scant few thousand years ago only the barest traces of a Cuyahoga river course were visible, here a rock tossed by the glaciers to turn the flow, there a valley etched by some river of the past.

After this wanton leap, the Cuyahoga slows down to meander. The sides of the buried canyon form a margin; the river tries the limits of its prison, touching first one wall and then the other while scooping its own flat bed toward the lake, dropping two feet to the mile. In the final reach, the Cuyahoga leaves the old bed, audaciously looping away to cut a new and kinky path to the lake it has sought for ninety miles.\r\n\t\r\nAnd now, because it was made as it was, men who live on it, astride it, and beside it, will live their lives a certain way."},{"title":"In Better Health","author":"Dan Bobkoff","year":"2009","category":"interview","content":"Forty years ago today, a spark flew from a train crossing a low bridge over the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland.

It teams with fish and wildlife. \r\n\r\nEven today, tell someone you live in Cleveland, and invariably you'll hear: Doesn't your river catch on fire? Nevermind that in the middle of the 20th century, rivers in industrial cities across the country caught on fire all the time. Nevermind it's been four decades since the Cuyahoga's infamous blaze that only lasted about a half hour. That image of a sludge and oil-filled river on fire persists. But today's river could not be more different.\n\nWhat they're finding today are dozens of kinds of fish, from red horses to steelhead. And another good sign: Many of the fish they find hate pollution. In the early 1980s, when they started keeping track, parts of this river were so polluted that virtually nothing could survive. Many of these same sections are now rated as exceptional for fish habitat. Some parts of the river near Akron still have problems with sewage and runoff, but in much of the Cuyahoga, beavers, herons and even bald eagles thrive.

The name came from a Greek word meaning \"an elevation\" or \"point.\" Originally, the community was located slightly south of its present location, in modern-day South Akron. Many of the town's earliest residents were Irish migrants employed to build the nearby Ohio and Erie Canal. After 1827, when the canal was completed between Akron and Cleveland, the community's business interests really began to prosper. Its location along the canal meant that many farmers brought their crops to Akron to be milled and then transported to other markets, and manufacturing interests such as mills, furnaces, and textiles also emerged. By the second half of the 1800s, railroads connected the community to other important cities in Ohio, and other industries emerged.\n\nThere were a number of stoneware and cereal manufacturers, as well as a well-known sewer pipe industry. The Barber Match Company, later a branch of the Diamond Match Company, produced one-fifth of all the matches in the United States. The Buckeye Mower and Reaper Company, originally located in Canton, moved to Akron in 1863. Probably among the most famous companies established in Akron were the B.F. Goodrich Company and the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, both rubber and tire manufacturers that began to prosper after the advent of the automobile age. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, many migrants from the Appalachian region and European immigrants came to Akron looking for work in these industries.

It is when unexamined assumptions of mind and nature are shaken that we are most moved, in the arts and science. Against gravity and entropic loss, a poem proposes the levitations of fine excess and gratuitous beauty\u2014sound-trance\u2019s memorability; the aerial devices of implication; metaphor\u2019s democratic conjugation with all existence; the praise of whatever it is for what it is. In a painting, a small square of sunlight rests on a rounded shoulder of a glass vase, preserved impossibly against time\u2019s passage; the pause in a piece of music by Mozart stops the heart for no reason except that is it there.\n\nAgainst transience, art provides a witnessing endurance, against the stringencies of survival, it offers the moment\u2019s dalliance or chosen disappearance. The love poem of fulfillment carries somewhere within it, however lightly, the shadow of time and death. A painted apple cannot be eaten.

Let\u2019s fight for each other, not just the \u201cDREAMer.\u201d"},{"title":"The Making of Meaningful Voice","author":"Beverly Warren","year":"2016","category":"speech","content":"Recently, I have been exploring the core questions that many are asking about colleges and universities. Why do we exist? What do we stand for? What is our legacy contribution to better society? How will Kent State make a difference in a world that so desperately needs reasoned and inspiring voices\u2014particularly in a wilderness of biased rhetoric that sets the bar so low for a nation that has such high aspirations for the ideals of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness? We need only to look at this presidential election cycle to know that we have much work ahead of us to move beyond the negativity to reach new heights of meaningful dialogue.\n\nIn a re-imagined public research university, we will emphasize the preparation of our students to be the next generation of leaders by ensuring the right focus on the right dispositions to better society. A re-imagined public research university will also embrace the idea that the priorities for academic excellence, access, and affordability not only coexist, but merge as critical elements of a high-quality, distinctive learning environment. At Kent State, we are calling this commitment \u201cThe Kent State Promise.\u201d"},{"title":"The Sculptor","author":"William Donohue Ellis","year":"1966","category":"book","content":"Even a scant few thousand years ago only the barest traces of a Cuyahoga river course were visible, here a rock tossed by the glaciers to turn the flow, there a valley etched by some river of the past. But until very late, there was nothing to suggest that this stream\u2019s headwaters would originate just fifteen miles from the lake into which it should empty [...]\n\nJoyously, the Cuyahoga begins to run at Akron, then leaps into a series of rapids at the Cuyahoga Falls to rush north through the mile-and-a-half gorge. After this wanton leap, the Cuyahoga slows down to meander. The sides of the buried canyon form a margin; the river tries the limits of its prison, touching first one wall and then the other while scooping its own flat bed toward the lake, dropping two feet to the mile. In the final reach, the Cuyahoga leaves the old bed, audaciously looping away to cut a new and kinky path to the lake it has sought for ninety miles.\r\n\t\r\nAnd now, because it was made as it was, men who live on it, astride it, and beside it, will live their lives a certain way."},{"title":"The Beauty of Life","author":"William Morris","year":"1882","category":"speech","content":"As I look round on this assemblage, and think of all that it represents, I cannot choose but be moved to the soul by the troubles of the life of civilised man, and the hope that thrusts itself through them; I cannot refrain from giving you once again the message with which, as it seems, some chance-hap has charged me: that message is, in short, to call on you to face the latest danger which civilisation is threatened with, a danger of her own breeding: that men in struggling towards the complete attainment of all the luxuries of life for the strongest portion of their race should deprive their whole race of all the beauty of life: a danger that the strongest and wisest of mankind, in striving to attain to a complete mastery over nature, should destroy her simplest and widest-spread gifts, and thereby enslave simple people to them, and themselves to themselves, and so at last drag the world into a second barbarism more ignoble, and a thousandfold more hopeless\n\nNow of you who are listening to me, there are some, I feel sure, who have received this message, and taken it to heart, and are day by day fighting the battle that it calls on you to fight: to you I can say nothing but that if any word I speak discourage you, I shall heartily wish I had never spoken at all: but to be shown the enemy, and the castle we have got to storm, is not to be bidden to run from him; nor am I telling you to sit down deedless in the desert because between you and the promised land lies many a trouble, and death itself maybe: the hope before you you know, and nothing that I can say can take it away from you; but friend may with advantage cry out to friend in the battle that a stroke is coming from this side or that: take my hasty words in that sense, I beg of you.\n\nBut I think there will be others of you in whom vague discontent is stirring: who are oppressed by the life that surrounds you; confused and troubled by that oppression, and not knowing on which side to seek a remedy, though you are fain to do so: well, we, who have gone further into those troubles, believe that we can help you: true we cannot at once take your trouble from you; nay, we may at first rather add to it; but we can tell you what we think of the way out of it; and then amidst the many things you will have to do to set yourselves and others fairly on that way, you will many days, nay most days, forget your trouble in thinking of the good that lies beyond it, for which you are working.\n\nBut, again, there are others amongst you (and to speak plainly, I daresay they are the majority), who are not by any means troubled by doubt of the road the world is going, nor excited by any hope of its bettering that road: to them the cause of civilisation is simple and even commonplace: it wonder, hope, and fear no longer hang about it; has become to us like the rising and setting of the sun; it cannot err, and we have no call to meddle with it, either to complain of its course, or to try to direct it."},{"title":"The Lesser Arts","author":"William Morris","year":"1882","category":"essay","content":"I know what stupendous difficulties, social and economical, there are in the way of this; yet I think that they seem to be greater than they are: and of one thing I am sure, that no real living decorative art is possible if this is impossible.\r\n\r\nIt is not impossible, on the contrary it is certain to come about, if you are at heart desirous to quicken the arts; if the world will, for the sake of beauty and decency, sacrifice some of the things it is so busy over (many of which I think are not very worthy of its trouble), art will begin to grow again; as for those difficulties above mentioned, some of them I know will in any case melt away before the steady change of the relative conditions of men; the rest, reason and resolute attention to the laws of nature, which are also the laws of art, will dispose of little by little: once more, the way will not be far to seek, if the will be with us.\n\nYet, granted the will, and though the way lies ready to us, we must not be discouraged if the journey seem barren enough at first, nay, not even if things seem to grow worse for a while: for it is natural enough that the very evil which has forced on the beginning of reform should look uglier, while on the one hand life and wisdom are building up the new, and on the other folly and deadness are hugging the old to them.\r\n\r\nIn this, as in all other matters, lapse of time will be needed before things seem to straighten, and the courage and patience that does not despise small things lying ready to be done; and care and watchfulness, lest we begin to build the wall ere the footings are well in; and always through all things much humility that is not easily cast down by failure, that seeks to be taught, and is ready to learn."},{"title":"What\u2019s the Deal with Black Squirrels","author":"Dapope","year":"2013","category":"essay","content":"In any case, at some point there was a mutation that gave some squirrels black fur, and for some reason they became relatively successful in certain areas. Then perhaps they were introduced to other areas, or just spread there naturally. They belong to the same species, so when black squirrels get with grey squirrels, or other black squirrels, fertile baby black squirrels result, sometimes in mixed litters with other colors. Perhaps these days the grey squirrel has a greater advantage camouflage-wise, but in urban areas where large predators are driven away by human activity the black squirrels could just as easily flourish. The mystery! The intrigue! The more I look into this, the more I\u2019m fascinated. This is my favorite theory that I found: Apparently the thing that might be giving black squirrels the edge, according to the aforementioned radio story, is that the males seem to have more testosterone.\n\nProbably a female squirrel is more willing to get with the squirrel that has higher testosterone levels given that he works out and drives a sweet car. Also, picture this: A grey squirrel approaches a nut\u2014possibly one that struck someone\u2019s head outside of WesWings\u2014and then a black squirrel approaches and makes angry squirrel noises. In this situation the grey squirrel is more likely to back off, owing to its lowered levels of aggressiveness. Long story short, the black squirrel appears more able to protect its nuts. No pun intended."},{"title":"The History of Kent: Historical and biographical.","author":"K.H. Grismer","year":"1932","category":"book","content":"The village of Franklin Mills undoubtedly owed its existence to the Cuyahoga River, for it was this river, rushing and roaring through the narrow gorge above and below the present Crain Avenue bridge, which provided the water-power needed for the operation of grist and saw mills. As was the case throughout the entire Western Reserve, mills were built where waterpower existed, and where mills were built, there sprang up some of the most thriving settlements. The first person who sensed the possibilities of the river was Jacob Haymaker, a millwright and carpenter of German descent who prospected through the county in the spring of 1805, seeking a home site in the vast and practically unsettled wilderness.\n\nDuring the long winter which followed, the Haymakers\u2019 only visitors were Indians who came from their villages at Silver Lake and Cuyahoga Falls to see how white people lived. One day a squaw who came to visit took her papoose from her hack and stood the board to which it was attached against the hut. While she was inside talking to Mrs. Haymaker a wild hog came along, grabbed the baby, and ran helter-skelter through the underbrush. The squaw managed to rescue her baby but only after a hard fight with the animal."}]
